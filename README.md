## About GisungIn
### Goals
Since the outbreak of the COVID 19, more and more people are turning to developers. As a lot of non-majors also turn their jobs, many platforms that offer various development-related internet lectures were naturally created. Some of these lectures are provided for free, while the major of them are provided for profit.     
So, we would like to create a new non-profit platform where all people interested in development, regardless of age or gender, can receive customized development education materials at the university level.
```
Offering the Sources of Education to the future Developers and Personalizing the lectures to gather preference related to those sources by simple motion

### Effect

If you are interested in or willing to participate in the source recommended on the website, Right click. Otherwise, Left click. If you are interested and willing to join, Swipe Right. Otherwise, Swipe left. The accumulated user's "MyLectures" result in appear as increasingly customized results.


## Website Functions
